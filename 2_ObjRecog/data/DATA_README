SECCORA

The imagery and associated label data have been curated especially for this course.

We have used publicly available web camera imagery from the SouthEast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association's WebCAT service. WebCAT stands for the NOAA NOS (National Observing System) Web Camera Applications Testbed. These cameras have various purposes, for example counting right whales, identifying rip currents, validating wave models, and understanding human use of beaches, etc. Of the web cameras in seven locations, we will only use imagery from the the camera installed at one site, namely St. Augustine Pier, Florida.
