NWPU

publicly available benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). The entire dataset contains 31,500 high-resolution images from Google Earth imagery, in 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. The majority of those classes are urban/anthropogenic. We chose to use a subset of 11 classes corresponding to natural landforms and land cover, namely: beach, chaparral, desert, forest, island, lake, meadow, mountain, river, sea ice, and wetland.

TAMUCC

Publicly available imagery of coastal environments in Texas, provided by the Harte Research Institute at TAMUCC (Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi), funded by the Texas General Land Office (GLO).

Images such as the example above are oblique, taken from a low-altitude aircraft with approximate positions. In total, there are over 10,000 images covering the whole Texas coastline, each categorized by one of the following dominant classes ("developed" classes are in bold):

    Exposed walls and other structures made of concrete, wood, or metal
    Scarps and steep slopes in clay
    Wave-cut clay platforms
    Fine-grained sand beaches
    Scarps and steep slopes in sand
    Coarse-grained sand beaches
    Mixed sand and gravel (shell) beaches
    Gravel (shell) beaches
    Exposed riprap structures
    Exposed tidal flats
    Sheltered solid man-made structures, such as bulkheads and docks
    Sheltered riprap structures
    Sheltered scarps
    Sheltered tidal flats
    Salt- and brackish-water marshes
    Fresh-water marshes (herbaceous vegetation)
    Fresh-water swamps (woody vegetation)
    Mangroves

The dataset is described further here. The dataset will be provided during the course, and is also available on Google Cloud Storage bucket gs://aju-demos-coastline-images/coastline
